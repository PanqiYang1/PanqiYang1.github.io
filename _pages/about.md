I am currently a Master's student at **Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)**, and I am fortunate to continue my research journey as an **incoming Ph.D. student** at XJTU in Fall 2026.

My research interests lie in **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**, with a specific focus on:
*   **Multimodal Understanding & Generation:** Bridging the gap between visual perception and content creation.
*   **Embodied AI:** WIP

I am passionate about building unified systems that can perceive, reason, and generate in open-world scenarios.
